      <h1>Welcome to Bug Diary</h1>
      <p>
        BugDiary is a simple-to-use issue-reporting and bug-tracking platform
        that's built for everyone.
      </p>
      <h2>For You and Your Audience</h2>
      <p>
        If someone encounters a bug while using your project, they can report it
        to your BugDiary without signing up for an account.
      </p>
      <p>
        BugDiary is a non-technical bug tracker, meaning that anyone can pick it
        up and start using it. You can get set up in less than 5 minutes
        (including registration)!
