# BugDiary

IMPORTANT UPDATE:
This project has been deprecated. There are many good project management and bug tracking software out there, making this not as useful. I've personally stopped using BugDiary, the users have been notified, and the website was recently taken down. You can still set this up locally, the default database has been changed to SQLite, as it'll be completely self-contained.

BugDiary is an online bug-tracking and issue-reporting platform that's easy to pick up and use. Please visit www.bugdiary.com/about to learn more about this project. Version 2 is currently in the works with major UI and performance improvements.

## Who is BugDiary for?

It's for anyone who manages a project and wants a simple way to keep track of issues. It's especially useful if your project involves pilot-testing with a group of testers, because testers can report errors without signing up for an account!

Advanced users can take advantage of the BugDiary API to allow for issue-reporting directly from your website.

## Why BugDiary?

BugDiary helps you manage several projects at once, helping you keep track of activities at a glance.
